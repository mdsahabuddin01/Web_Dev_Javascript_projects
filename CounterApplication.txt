This is a simple interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a counter with increment and decrement buttons and tracks the number of times each button is clicked. The click counters reset after reaching 10, and the main counter doesn't go below zero. The clean, centered design makes it user-friendly and visually appealing. Ideal for beginners to understand DOM manipulation and basic event handling in JavaScript.
